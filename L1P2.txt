Jack of all trades, master of none. It is a famous phrase used to describe a generalist, who develop skills in many domains, or in other words focus on breadth . On the other hand we have the specialists, who spend time and effort in developing skills in one particular domain, or in other words focus on depth

There has been plenty of debate on which strategy is optimal for career success. Personally, this question has been lingering for several years. Both sides offer unique advantages. So who’s right? Lets find out-

I’m going to provide two case studies. 

Case study number 1 revolves around a young boy growing in Europe was involved in many different sports. His mother was a tennis coach but didnt like playing with him because he always returned the ball in strange and funny ways. He dabbled around in basketball, swimming, skiing and most notably football. In his early teens he started playing tennis again, but by that time his peers had already been years ahead in terms of tennis specific development, with their own trainers and nutritionists. However soon enough he began to outpace his peers and eventually become the best tennis player for almost 2 decades. His name? Any guesses? Roger Federer.

Case study number 2 is about a child was given a toy golf putter by his father at the age of 10 months. Soon enough he was imitating his father’s golf swing. By the age of 2 he’s on national television. By the age of 4 he’s won an under-10 national golf competition. His father recognised his child’s talent and actively promoted it by engaging his son in deliberate practise. This turned out to be a great approach. He consistently was the best player at his age bracket and this focused approach this led to him being the world champion at the age of just 21.
Can you guess who this individual is?
Yes correct, this is the story of one of the greatest golfers the world has ever seen- Tiger woods. 

So which do you think is the better strategy and is likely to succeed in most cases - Roger or Tiger?

So who’s right? Lets dig deeper

The advocates of specialists often align with renowned author - Malcolm Gladwell. In his book, Outliers, Gladwell explains that to become an expert at anything, you must spend 10,000 hours of deliberate practice. Thus its corollary - specialising early is an advantage as you can clock more hours in deliberate practice ahead of your slower competitors. He argues that the best chess grandmasters or golfers, like Tiger woods, display this and this can be extended to any other field as well. Thats quite convincing..

On the other we hand we have the generalists, led by David Epstein, author of best selling book - Range. David agrees with Malcolm with  the examples he provided - chess and golf. However he argues that the same logic cannot be extended to other domains. Turns out golf is a horrible example to model most things in our lives. Golf is the epitome of kind learning environments - where rules are fixed, where goals and next steps that are clear, when you do something feedback is quick and accurate, work this year is like work last year. On the other hand we have wicked learning environments - rules can change, next steps are unclear, and feedback may be delayed or inaccurate, and work this year may not look like work last year.

Which model do you think resembles the world we’re currently living in?

So lets discuss a little bit about some of the reasons why generalists have an edge 

Firstly, you develop a broad range of skills which are transferrable. This provides a unique advantage over early specialisers. Consider Claude Shannon. He was studying electrical engineering when took a philosophy course just to fulfil a requirement. There he came across a system of logic where True and False statement were encoded as 1s and 0s. Combining his knowledge from engineering, it led to the development of binary code.

Secondly, you undergo a sampling period. As mentioned in the case study, Federer explored many sports and only then selected tennis. This is what we call match quality. For example even the greatest musicians have a sampling period. They dont usually learn an instrument and solely stick to that.

Another key observation is that hyperspecialisation narrows your problem solving ability. As you go deeper and deeper you get exposed to only certain types of problems. Your cognitive flexibility declines, your approach becomes very procedural and your vision myopic.

Generalisation might be even more applicable in the current landscape of knowledge work, where everything is changing rapidly, technologies are evolving by the day. Tools like ChatGPT are just the beginning. These are extremely wicked environments. The generalists are better equipped for this climate.

One of the earliest recorded use of the phrase “Jack of all trades ” as an insult dates back to 1592. It was used as a jab on a poet who did not have a university education, who involved in various roles, like copying scripts and bit-part acting, even trying to write plays. The poet being referred to: Willian Shakepeare. The phrase has evolved over time to just “Jack of all trades, master of none”. What we dont know, is that the original full length version is - “Jack of all trades, master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one”
